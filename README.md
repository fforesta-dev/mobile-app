# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this mobile application to improve my skills in Android development using Kotlin and to gain experience building interactive mobile applications with persistent data storage.

This app is a flashcard application designed to help users learn basic Italian expressions. Users can view flashcards, reveal answers, move between cards, add new flashcards, edit existing ones, and delete flashcards. All flashcards are saved locally so they remain available even after closing the app.

The purpose of creating this app was to practice mobile development concepts such as multiple activities, user interaction, data persistence using SharedPreferences, and user interface design that works in both light and dark mode.

Here is a link to a video demonstration of the app, showing the app running and a walkthrough of the code:

# Development Environment

This application was developed using Android Studio as the main development environment. The app was tested using the Android Emulator and an Android physical device.

The programming language used for this project is Kotlin. The app uses standard Android libraries, Android Activities for navigation between screens, and SharedPreferences with JSON for local data storage.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to improve this application by adding the following features:
* Add categories for different Italian topics such as greetings, verbs, and travel phrases
* Add a shuffle mode to display flashcards in random order
* Add audio pronunciation for Italian words
